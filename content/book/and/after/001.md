I can think of better times to release a book than the spring of 2020. Something about a worldwide pandemic, well-justified protests, murder hornets, all that nonsense.

> It was not your decision for 2020 to go nuts.

Right. Still. To be a white person trying to release a book in the middle of one of the biggest race struggles in my lifetime (at least, that I remember; I was alive in 1992, but far more focused on first grade) felt weird. Disingenuous. Like I was taking away from the conversation.

And yet that date had been set long before. June 1 was chosen way back in February when I got it set up with the distributor, Kirkus, and Publishers Weekly. February was before COVID was even a whole big thing. I lost my job and had to keep an eye on finances, so the pre-orders suddenly became incredibly important.

It was far outside my control by the time all of those things took off into something exciting and terrible.

> And yet..?

And yet I still struggle with it. To come from a position of privilege and yet still feel obligated to release the book on the specified date was not a great feeling. Who was I to be taking away from that conversation? Who was I to ask others to take a step away from this very important work to come look at me.
