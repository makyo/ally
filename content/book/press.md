<span class="ally-font">ally</span> is a semiautobiographical work by Madison Scott-Clary focusing on the mutability of the past. The book is written in the form of a conversation between the author and an alter ego which refers to itself as not a friend, but an ally.

Like memory, it is disjointed and full of tangents and asides as topics come in and out of focus. This is shown through the construction of the book, where multiple stories will take place at the same time on each page, page and text colors will alter the mood, and images and old diary entries will crop up.

Memories follow the topics of gender, identity, mental health (including bipolar disorder, medication, and suicidality), and creativity.
