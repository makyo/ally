Hey. I just wanted to say, and I'm sure you've been hearing this a lot, that your book is one heck of a creative spark.  (It's also the most incredible thing I've read since _Fun Home_, which is probably my all time favorite autobiography).
Amber bought me a copy as a gift and I haven't been able to put it down since (except for breaks because dang is this intense).

Madison Scott-Clary, [23.06.20 19:50]
Oh gosh oh gosh!

Madison Scott-Clary, [23.06.20 19:50]
Thank you so much ;.;

Kimmy Mars, [23.06.20 19:56]
Of course. :)

Kimmy Mars, [23.06.20 19:56]
Thank _you_.

I'm afraid that Lady Syka has more or less piqued my fancy here so I will say that I find it fascinating too.

Madison Scott-Clary, [23.06.20 20:05]
Syka good birb

Kimmy Mars, [23.06.20 20:11]
Heh. she is indeed

Kimmy Mars, [23.06.20 20:31]
You know I have to admit I'm a bit sad that I never read your writing earlier than this. Although I only just got back into readin in the past year

Kimmy Mars, [23.06.20 20:42]
Your socratical inquiries remind me somewhat of my convos with my own daemon

Kimmy Mars, [23.06.20 20:43]
although mostly not at all because my daemon is a lot more sweary and a lot less helpful at self inquiry

Kimmy Mars, [23.06.20 20:43]
Although she tells me that's because i haven't gotten her drunk first before asking her to have a philosophical inquiry about my life

Kimmy Mars, [23.06.20 20:44]
Anyway, I'll leave you to your evening, need to cook dinner myself. if you ever wish to chat I would be delighted, and seriously, you have done an incredibly job with this book.

Madison Scott-Clary, [23.06.20 20:50]
Thank you for checking in about this! It's very good to hear. Kinda struggling to keep up, alas. Enjoy cooking and such.

btw, your book has been described as a "cognitohazard" (in the best possible way)

Syka Bee, [23.06.20 00:09]
> okay so warning. if you are like, if you have mental illness make sure you are in the right mind before reading that book and take breaks
> But it's incredible. it's so amazing

Madison Scott-Clary, [23.06.20 00:12]
Whoa @.@

Madison Scott-Clary, [23.06.20 00:12]
Was this ally? :O

Syka Bee, [23.06.20 00:12]
Also you have been responsible for at least 1 (one) dreamwidth account signup in introspective response

Syka Bee, [23.06.20 00:13]
Yeah, Kimmy (the one in Seattle) got her copy

Madison Scott-Clary, [23.06.20 00:15]
Ohhh gosh @.@

Syka Bee, [23.06.20 00:16]
She's compared it to _Decrypting Rita_ in terms of epiphany effect on her so far, so

Syka Bee, [23.06.20 00:16]
*patpat* good crow~

Madison Scott-Clary, [23.06.20 00:17]
Caw uvu

Syka Bee, [23.06.20 00:17]
(it's not a thing I've read so I don't know what it is)

Madison Scott-Clary, [23.06.20 00:17]
I have a copy, but have yet to actually sit down with it. It's daunting

Syka Bee, [23.06.20 00:20]
Also, as far as first impressions, she loved the box and she was pretty much instantly piqued just flipping through as one does when one gets a new book

Madison Scott-Clary, [23.06.20 00:21]
It was a very fun set of nouns to build. I like the online project a lot, of course, but building a book was a trip
