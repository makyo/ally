If I am to become a brand, it is best, perhaps, that I own it and at least try to do a good job of it.

How could it not be? If I am to become a brand, and I am ever trying to become a better person, to be seen as someone good and worthwhile, mightn't it be a good idea to try and do a good job of that? To make a good impression?

Well, I can hardly hold a launch party in person in this longest of decades, spring of 2020.

So.

## <span class="ally-font" style="font-size: 21pt">ally</span> online launch party --- Monday, June 1, 2020

Come, friends, and join me for a small launch party for <span class="ally-font">ally</span>. It will as a matter of course be a BYOB party, but I would love to have you join me live on [Picarto](https://picarto.tv/makyo) and [&#68;&#105;scord](https://makyo.io/2G)! We'll have all sorts.

* Meet the author, call her a dork to her face.
* Take a tour through the book, both a physical copy and a PDF.
* Learn about the process of writing, publishing online, typesetting, and self-publishing a book.
* Get some discounts on both paperbacks and PDFs!
* I don't know, there will probably also be cameos from my dogs.

Mark your calendars, for you are formally invited to join me on *Monday, June 1st, 2020* at both *3:00PM* and *7:00PM* Pacific time for an hour of Books and Chill.
