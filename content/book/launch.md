If I am to become a brand, it is best, perhaps, that I own it and at least try to do a good job of it.

How could it not be? If I am to become a brand, and I am ever trying to become a better person, to be seen as someone good and worthwhile, mightn't it be a good idea to try and do a good job of that? To make a good impression?

Well, I can hardly hold a launch party in person in this longest of decades, spring of 2020.

So.

## <span class="ally-font" style="font-size: 21pt">ally</span> online launch party --- Monday, June 1, 2020

Come, friends, and join me for a small launch party for <span class="ally-font">ally</span>. It will as a matter of course be a BYOB party, but I would love to have you join me live on [Picarto](https://picarto.tv/makyo) and [&#68;&#105;scord](https://makyo.io/2G)! We'll have all sorts.

* Meet the author, call her a dork to her face.
* Take a tour through the book, both a physical copy and a PDF.
* Learn about the process of writing, publishing online, typesetting, and self-publishing a book.
* Get some discounts on both paperbacks and PDFs!
* I don't know, there will probably also be cameos from my dogs.

I'll also talk about the making of this project specifically via the making-of companion. <em class="ally-font">ally from start to finish</em> is a short companion book explaining how the project was made, both the website ally.id and the book. It talks about the structure, the tools and the pitfalls encountered along the way. It also comes with the source for itself so that you can see some of what goes into producing a book like this (as <span class="ally-font">ally</span> uses much the same structure).
