<pre class="verse">The only time I know my true name is when I pray.

The only time I pray is at the utmost need.

To pray is to ask yourself what you dare not ask god.

To answer your own question, you must step outside yourself.

To step outside yourself, you must forget your true name.

The only time I know my true name is when I pray.</pre>
