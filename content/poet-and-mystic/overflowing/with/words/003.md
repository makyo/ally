At the beginning of time, when chaos birthed to order and disorder, we were blessed with two souls. One has seven eyes and can see all of the monsters in the dark, but is blinded by the sun. The other has no eyes, but can feel no pain. When order and disorder were close as children, our souls experienced the world hand in hand, but as they drifted apart and began to fight, some of us left one of our souls behind, and that is why we search.
