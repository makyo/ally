<pre class="verse">At the beginning of time,
&nbsp; &nbsp; when chaos birthed to order and disorder,
we were blessed with two souls.

One has seven eyes and can see all of the monsters in the dark,
&nbsp; &nbsp; but is blinded by the sun.

The other has no eyes,
&nbsp; &nbsp; but can feel no pain.

When order and disorder were close as children,
&nbsp; our souls experienced the world hand in hand,
&nbsp; &nbsp; but as they drifted apart and began to fight,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some of us left one of our souls behind,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that is why we search.</pre>
