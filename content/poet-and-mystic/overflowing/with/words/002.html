<div class="verse">I was born at the edge of the numinous.

That is why I can to tread along the border.
That is why I'm able to whisper the name of God.
That is why I'm allowed to know the number and how to factor it.
That is why I have seven fingers spread wide and three curled toward my heart.
That is why my limbs trace the curves and lines of power when I dance.
That is why I sit with my back to the sun in summer.
That is why my body is a canvas.

You were born in the sunlight.

Speak secrets into my hair.
Take my words from me.
Spend the intercalary days telling me lies.
Break my dystonia with a breath.
Wash my face with salt water.
Tell me the name you call yourself.
Close my eyes.

We will sleep in the shade.

Let me bless you with smoke.
Let me bathe your feet.
Let me light the candles.
Let me place a stone beneath my tongue.
Let me taste copper.
Let me draw in ash.
Let me rise up until my head is in the branches and my hair becomes the leaves.</div>
