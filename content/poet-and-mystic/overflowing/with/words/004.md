Babel was a collaborative effort. Once, we all spoke the same language, but on seeing god grow increasingly anxious with the rate of our progress, we agreed to let our tongues be confused, so that he could take things at a more comfortable pace, and we could be assured he would not understand us unless we prayed in silence, for only then do we speak the language of angels.
