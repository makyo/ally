How does one approach what one can't describe?

> Swing the flashlight rapidly across the room. Piece together what you can from the sweep of the beam across the walls, the furniture.

How does one hunt down what leaves no tracks?

> Unwind the maze by keeping your right hand on the wall. Pray that the walls do not move.

How does one call down the gods to commune?

> Speak thrice, and enter.
