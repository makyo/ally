How can I capture that essence of stillness? How can I become nothing?

> Not reaching. Not trying.

How can I read the ecstasy of signs? How can I feel those black birds bursting free of my hunched shoulders?

> Step beside yourself. Take your own hand.

How can I feel the cord that ties me to the center of the earth? How can I see where it leads? How can I walk the spiral?

> Reach down, bury your fingers in rich earth, take root.

The cant of ritual.

> The scent of incense.

The rhythm of chant.

> The ripple of water.

Call and response.

> The flicker of a candle.

Voices echoing voices echoing voices echoing...

> Clay between fingertips.

And then?
