I'm tired. I'm so tired. I'm tired and I'm upset and I'm lost.

> I know.

I want to shout and to whisper. I want to talk about how the light flows <a class="pulse" href="/poet-and-mystic/agony-and-ecstasy">in through the head and out through the heart</a>. I want to put words to the feeling of falling to the ground and taking root.

I want to say how it feels when I step outside myself.

> You tried.

I guess that's all I can do.

> It's not, but it's important that you have tried.
