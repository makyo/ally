I'm tired. I'm so tired. I'm tired and I'm upset and I'm lost.

> I know.

I want to shout and to whisper. I want to talk about how I feel when I read Stevens or Esch or Rilke. I want to put words to the feeling of falling to the ground and taking root.

I want to say how it feels when I step outside myself.

> You tried.

I guess that's all I can do.

> It's not, but it's important that you have tried.
