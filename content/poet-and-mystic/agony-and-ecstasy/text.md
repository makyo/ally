<div class="verse"><strong>I</strong>
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>II</strong>
I was of three minds,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>III</strong>
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.
It was a small part of the pantomime.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>IV</strong>
A man and a woman
Are one.
A man and a woman and a blackbird
Are one.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>V</strong>
I do not know which to prefer,
The beauty of inflections
Or the beauty of innuendoes,
The blackbird whistling
Or just after.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>VI</strong>
Icicles filled the long window
With barbaric glass.
The shadow of the blackbird
Crossed it, to and fro.
The mood
Traced in the shadow
An indecipherable cause.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>VII</strong>
O thin men of Haddam,
Why do you imagine golden birds?
Do you not see how the blackbird
Walks around the feet
Of the women about you?</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>VIII</strong>
I know noble accents
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;
But I know, too,
That the blackbird is involved
In what I know.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>IX</strong>
When the blackbird flew out of sight,
It marked the edge
Of one of many circles.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>X</strong>
At the sight of blackbirds
Flying in a green light,
Even the bawds of euphony
Would cry out sharply.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>XI</strong>
He rode over Connecticut
In a glass coach.
Once, a fear pierced him,
In that he mistook
The shadow of his equipage
For blackbirds.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>XII</strong>
The river is moving.
The blackbird must be flying.</div>

<div class="verse"><strong>XIII</strong>
It was evening all afternoon.
It was snowing
And it was going to snow.
The blackbird sat
In the cedar-limbs.</div>

<em>&mdash; Wallace Stevens</em>
