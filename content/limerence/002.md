<div class="verse">I live my life in eternal terror
of the completeness of your own.
I take up so little space
and impinge upon it so gently,
I only hope that there is space enough
for a 'dear' here and a 'lovely' there.
If beauty is at the edge of the terrifying,
I live my life in eternal terror.</div>
