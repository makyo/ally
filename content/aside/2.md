> Are you having fun?

What?

> You changed the domain name.

So? You know I'm addicted to those.

> It's an identity.

I suppose so. Kinda like a brand.

> I'm not sure how I feel about that.

What, being a brand?

> Yes. Am I something to be bought and sold? Am I something to be traded and marketed?

Of course you are.

> Of course you are.

I'm not sure how I feel about that.

> It's an identity.

Yeah.

> You removed your name from the domain. You removed your identity. You made it about me.

You are not the project, but there is no project without you. Is that wrong?

> It's not **not** wrong. Besides, `.id`? I am not your id.

Okay, *that* bit was fun.

> Har har.

Why so cross?

> Not my department.

Fine.

> You're the one that's torn.

I suppose so.

> Why?

It has to do with subdomains, I think. It has to do with the implication that a domain like `ally.id` imposes more meaning on a project than something like `ally.drab-makyo.com`. It gives it more weight. It elevates it to the status of top-level project, something more than just *Maddy's writing*.

> It elevates it to the level of brand.

Yeah, I suppose that's why I'm torn.

> But you'll keep it?

For now.
