<em class="ally-font">ally</em> is an ergodic, arborescent, semiautobiographical work about identity, mental health, spirituality, and the mutability of the past. A lot of the information contained within is real, some of it isn’t. Each page is structured as a conversation between myself and my ally, a mirror reflection of myself.

<em class="ally-font">ally.id</em> and the [book](/book) explore different facets of my life — some true, some embellished, some wholly fictitious — in a non-linear, ergodic fashion, using color, page-layout, and mixed-media to create a book more experience than memoir.

The idea was originally cribbed from Dale Pendell's wonderful *Pharmako/\** trilogy back in my late teens, but has since taken on a life of its own. Other inspirations are Mark Z. Danielewski's <em><span style="color: blue">House</span> of Leaves</em> and J. J. Abrams and Doug Dorst's <em>S</em> for both their ergodic elements and the underlying autobiographical elements. On the hypertextual side, projects such as the old [Fray](http://fray.com/index-old.shtml) (notably the story [The Worm Within](https://fray.com/drugs/worm/)) and [Nobody Here](https://nobodyhere.com). Bonus points to [Ouverture Facile](http://www.ouverture-facile.com/) and the ilk for getting me thinking about online projects, even if this one isn't so riddly yet.

If you'd like to read more of my stuff, I have a [writing page](https://writing.drab-makyo.com) (which even includes [a plain old blog](https://writing.drab-makyo.com/blog/)) and a [writing portfolio](https://makyo.ink).
