> Thank you.

I was going to save that for September sixth.

> I know.

You made me cry.

> I know.

You hurt me.

> I know. It's been seven years.

<div class="verse"><em>Yit'gadal v'yit'kadash sh'mei raba</em>
Would that I had the faith
To pray daily.
Eleven months to let you go,
And an amen to end the sorrow.</div>

> It's okay to not let go of some things.

How? How so? How could that possibly be true? How could one possible grow as a person with not letting go of something?

> It's okay to not let go of some things, and to use them to inform your growth in the future. It's okay to use grief to become a better person.

I guess.

But it still hurts.

> I know. We can continue.
