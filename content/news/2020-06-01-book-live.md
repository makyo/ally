With all of the rush in getting the book going, I feel that I've ignored you.

> You have, yes.

I'm sorry.

> Don't be.

<!--more-->

I should be writing more on this. I think that there's a lot of things I *need* to write about not just stuff I would like to write about. The problem is, I've been focused more on the book than the content.

> Is that so bad?

No, I suppose not. Even so, expect more soon. For now, please enjoy the fact that the book is now for sale! You can find all the information you need [here](/book).

If you want to know more about the book, I've uploaded a video from the launch party (skip to 3:00 for the start of the content).

And as a bonus, if you would like to see the process of the box being cut, there's a video for that, too.

Now, if you'll forgive me, I am going to merge into the ground for a while and simply become earth.
