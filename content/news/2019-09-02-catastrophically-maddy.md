title: Catastrophically Maddy

> You seem to be working ever close to some platonic perfection of what means to be Maddy.

Yeah, this is one of those things where I seem to have looped all the way around from being proud of a work to being vaguely ashamed of it.

> It's not bad, it's just very Maddy. Intensely Maddy. Catastrophically Maddy.

Right.

So for those who are keeping track of all the goofy ergodic shit I do with my friend here--

Right. So for those who are keeping track, so far we have had:

* A site map generated using GraphViz
* Flashing GIFs of art of my fursoÃ±as faces pinned to the page by their third eyes.
* A guided meditation session accompanied by disjointed noise music which grows in intensity as the text corrupts.
* A foxy face peering over a wall thinking grawlix at you.
* A somewhat magical sigil that spins.

It's time to take that one step further, so the next section is told through git commits for the source code for this site.

> When do we get an ARG? And I'm still waiting on transclusion, by the way.

Give it time.
