Monday! Monday, I get the next box of ally books, which means SIGNING PARTY WITH MADDYPAWS.

That's right. If you missed the launch party, I'll be hosting something similar while I sign the next batch of books. Readings, typesetting, discounts, nerding out...

And what?

Caught out.

Well, there's some hugely important shit going on out there in the world, and I really don't want to take away from that. I can't help very well right now, given my situation, other than to not take away from the struggles others are facing. The least I could do was make room for it while still doing what I could to share my book. That Monday was pretty rough for a lot of folks.

> Fair enough. So, another set of readings?

Yes.

If I'm unable to do so at bookstores, I suppose I can have a little virtual book tour.

Please join me on Monday, June 15th at 6pm Pacific for a short get-together over [Picarto](https://picarto.tv/makyo) and [&#68;&#105;scord](https://makyo.io/2G)! We'll have all sorts.

> There we go.

Until then, please stay safe and stay healthy. Black lives matter, make room for black voices, and keep learning from those who have stuff to teach.
