Are you?

<!--more-->

> Yes.

Why?

> You have this project that's deeply interesting to you, deeply personal, and you let the world get in the way of that.

So? Was the stuff I was dealing with not important?

> It was.

So what's the problem?

> The problem is that the stuff that you were dealing with was all about how the stuff that you were dealing with was not interesting, not personal. The stuff that you were dealing with was about your disconnection from yourself.

Should I have done differently?

> No. I'm simply registering the fact that I'm upset.

Fair.
