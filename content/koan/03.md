A friend asked Maddy: why are you coating yourself with grease?

Maddy said: so that when I run through a field, no dirt will stick to me, and I won't get poked by thorns.

Maddy ran through the field, and wound up covered in dirt and scratches.

The friend said: better to not run.

<!-- The more Maddy tries to avoid worrying and thoughts, the more they plague her. Better to not try, to lose oneself in the task. The running does itself, and Maddy is lost. -->
