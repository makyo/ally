Maddy built a sand castle and it was washed away.

The first friend was sad about the sand castle for Maddy, and said: better to not build the sand castle and risk further sorrow.

The second friend said this was good, because Maddy saw adversity and built the castle anyway.

The third said this was good because Maddy was able to acknowledge the castle and let it pass.

A fourth said: better to have never built the castle. The sand is itself, the wave is itself, and Maddy remains.

The fifth was helping build a bigger, better sand castle.

<!-- The first is naive and confuses the sand castle for the work.

The second mistakes the struggle against the wave as a struggle against a greater idea.

The third sees too much Maddy in the equation. She is not bettering herself though adversity, she is building sand castles.

The fourth sees a truth, but forgets that truth is not static

The fifth does the work. -->
