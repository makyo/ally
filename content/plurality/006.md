> Will you start working with hypotheticals? Will that be the way you talk around this in circles? Will you say "If I presuppose that I am in some way plural or median or this or that, what would my life look like as compared to if I am not?"

No. Maybe. But not here. Not out loud.

> So quick an answer.

Yes. If I do those things, it will not be here because even if the author is dead, *I* agree with Rax. It is all well and good that this is a question worth considering, and I'm happy enough to acknowledge it here like this, in a roundabout way, but any further investigations would, I think, do a disservice to the project at hand and the roles we play, willing or not, in the endeavor. 

> Have you gotten it out of your system, then?

Maybe, maybe not.

> But you won't explore it here?

No. The answer probably isn't final, but it is an answer.

> Might you have if it had come up in some way other than the way it came up in the review?

Perhaps? Perhaps if I had considered "Huh, I sure do seem to talk about depressed Maddy as another person and I sure do have an entire project and published book utilizing the idea of a conversation with the other" I might have dug into it, but, as mentioned, it's very far down the priority list.

But that's not how it came up. It didn't come from me. This project isn't happening in a vacuum. I acknowledged this when I encrypted a post. I acknowledged this when I chose what to share and what not to. I acknowledged this when I embellished and obfuscated the truth. 

> And this is just proof of that.

Yes. This is another instance of that, and this is another choice to be made. This is not a thing to talk about here because it would cheapen the end result by casting strange light on you, on me, and on the relationship we have with each other.

That review forced me to face the fact that, in the end, we are not alone. That, of all things is something the book has brought me: the knowledge that we're not alone.
