Limerence is not a negative thing. This feeling, this need-tinged love is not a negative thing. Crushes are not negative. They add to my life. They make it what it is.

They're just sometimes a bit too...eucalyptus, you know?

> I do not.

Well, lets say that my relationship with JD is a comfortable amber or musk, and let's say that my relationship with Robin is a sort of caramel or cajeta, and let's say that my relationship with Judith is a sort of lilac, and so on. They're scents and flavors that have something of a fullness to them. A roundness. A softness.

> If you insist.

I do.

Then let's say that limerence bears the scent of eucalyptus, the taste of tea-tree oil. It's a sharp, intrusive sensation. It's not negative. It's not unpleasant.

It's just that it's intense enough to make my eyes water and to interrupt my thoughts. It takes over and I don't know what to do about it. It lingers, even away from the source.

> Uncomfortably pleasant, perhaps.

Very.
