Is it weird for me to be streaming writing like this?

> I don't know. Does it feel weird to you?

I guess. I feel like maybe it's weird to be writing for an audience (even if it's only theoretical). What sort of information can be gleaned from watching someone write in a word-processor? Method? Insight?

> Entertainment?

I don't know about that.

> Validation?

That's more like it, I suppose. It's a way to prove to others that I actually sit down and write these things. That there's someone there.

> That there's someone behind a memoir? How novel.

Well, yes. But that they take time, that they take energy. That it's a process and not a product.

> Is there some sense of validity that is lacking from simply publishing? Posting?

I don't know.

> You set up analytics on this site. And on your writing site.

I set up analytics on a lot of sites.

> But these in particular. Do you need to see that others see you?

I suppose I do. It's important to be recognized.

> Are you also doing this to get me to leave you alone about heavier topics?

Yes.
