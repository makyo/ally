How does one approach what one can't describe?

> Swing the flashlight rapidly across the room. Piece together what you can from the sweep of the beam across the walls, the furniture.

How does one hunt down what leaves no tracks?

> Unwind the maze by keeping your right hand on the wall. Pray that the walls do not move.

How does one call down the gods to commune?

> Speak thrice, and enter.

I'm tired. I'm so tired. I'm tired and I'm upset and I'm lost.

> I know.

I want to shout and to whisper. I want to talk about how I feel when I read Stevens or Esch or Rilke. I want to put words to the feeling of falling to the ground and taking root.

I want to say how it feels when I step outside myself.

> You tried.

I guess that's all I can do.

> It's not, but it's important that you have tried.
