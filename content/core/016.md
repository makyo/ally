A lot of times, when furries talk, they talk about their furso&ntilde;as as their ideal selves. I've found that it's more likely that their furso&ntilde;as are them at their most normal, most natural, most earnest.

It's strange that this venue seen as escapist by even its own members is basically just a means of exploring what it means to be earnest in an ironic world.

Every time I think we're living in a post-ironic world, the Internet proves me wrong.

> I wouldn't know.

Do you not experience irony?
