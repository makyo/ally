> Of course you can.

I can't. I can't talk about this. I thought I was done with it. I thought it would be easy enough to go back over this, but I can't.

> Tell me why not, then?

I just...I just remember how easy it was to fuck up so badly. I did that a few weeks ago, too. I fucked up real bad, and now I'm stuck with the consequences, all the mechanics of tending to a wound, and all I can think about is how easy it was. It was so easy. It was so easy.

Perhaps that's what saves you, in the end: the realization that you have a body leads to the realization that you're alive, confronting mortality leads to the acceptance of life.

It's harder to *not*.
