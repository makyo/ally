"Come with me," Kevin said, and beckoned me out of the office.

"Sorry about all of the freaking out," I mumbled, once we were out of
earshot.  "I think it has to do with the medication, I'm going to call
Dr.-"

"I need you to tell me what your plan is," my boss asked.

"Plan?"

"Plan to kill yourself."

"I...don't have a plan, I don't know why," I managed.
