<div class="cw">Self harm</div>

<pre class="verse">There is too much fire in me
&emsp; to be described by the soldering iron's tip.</pre>

> I must not fear.

<pre class="verse">Were I to draw it across my skin,
&emsp; it would all spill out at once.</pre>

> Fear is the mind-killer.

<pre class="verse">I'd melt, eaten whole by flames,
&emsp; and flow into a pool of molten glass.</pre>

> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

<pre class="verse">Sublimation would claim me,
&emsp; atoms would scatter, diffuse.</pre>

> I will face my fear.

<pre class="verse">I would be borne up through the clouds,
&emsp; and grow lighter by the second.</pre>

> I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

<pre class="verse">All that energy poured to the air around me,
&emsp; an imperceptible increase in temperature.</pre>

> And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

<pre class="verse">Particle would excite particle
&emsp; until I'm felt only as warmth on your face.</pre>

> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.

<pre class="verse">But even that would not be enough.</pre>

> Only I will remain.
