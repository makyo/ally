Mom and Jay got married when I was in elementary school. Fourth grade, maybe? It's a bit hazy.

> Life began in high school, remember?

Life began when I came out, I suppose. Or maybe when I ran away. Life began when I started to assert ownership over it.

> Who owned it before?

I thought my dad did. My dad and Jay, and they let my mom borrow me.

> What did you own.

Many gifts. A few hobbies. Later, an internet connection.
