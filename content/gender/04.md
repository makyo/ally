> So were you?

Was I what?

> Fucked. Were you fucked?

I think that's still to-be-determined.

> You don't seem fucked. I mean, life is harder now, I suppose. You've got to contend with a minority identity you never particularly wanted.

There's no denying that. I don't quite like that this is what I'm stuck with, but I do alright with it. I try to keep going as best I can, and I try to help others as much as I can along the way. Robin likes to call me a "trans psychopomp", but I suspect that's due in part to the word 'psychopomp' is really fun to say. I would say that she falls under that title as well.

> Do you see yourself as one? Do you see yourself as someone who guides others?

Not particularly. I feel like I'm doing everything by accident. I feel like I'm accidentally visibly trans. Like I can't help but be visibly trans, like that's what I've got to work with. That that helps others long the way is still something of a mystery. A pleasant one, but a mystery.

Still, the least I could do is not hurt, might as well put in the effort to be a help.

> Do you think that others see you as a resource?

Perhaps, though that has me worried. That's an awful lot of responsibility.

> Permit me to take a tangent.

Do I have a choice?

> You always have a choice.

If I say no, what will happen?

> Nothing.

You'll let me just carry on with what I was saying?

> Sure.

Do you have the power to stop me?

> No, but do you?

Ah.
