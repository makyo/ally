Are you me?

> You're going to have to qualify that further.

Am I? I don't know how much more there is to it. Are you Madison, or are you someone else? Are you a separate entity? Are you a different me? Are you Matthew, now the same age as Madison, looking in at her life from the outside with preternatural knowledge and asking, "Okay, who are you?" Are you the opposite of nostalgia, blessed with some greater knowledge, looking back at my past and commanding me to justify my actions? Are you me?

> Am I?

I don't know.
