Lest we forget our roots in nostalgia, I would like to take a brief step away from the question of what this is for a moment. I have more --- more questions, more thoughts, more words --- but I also have this.

February 2, 2004:

<pre class="verse">Falling falling, feeling fine,
Finding forms and making mine.
Pressing pressing, pushing past,
Picking paths and falling fast.
Running running, rarely rest,
Run the risk and pass the test.
Do it all and feel fine.
Do it all and feel fine.

Feeling fine, feeling fine,
Done it all and feeling fine.
Mustn't stop, mustn't stop,
Done it all, I'm feeling fine.

Push on, push on, don't slow up,
Push on, push on, push on past.
Run on, run on, don't fuck up,
Run on, run on, run on fast.
Hurry on, scurry on, speed on up,
Hurry on, scurry on, don't be last.
Do it all and feel fine.
Don't forget to feel fine.

Feeling fine, feeling fine,
Done it all and feeling fine.
Mustn't stop, mustn't stop,
Done it all, I'm feeling fine.

Tried and tried, I tried and tried,
Ran the risk, failed the test.
Lied and lied, I lied and lied,
Picked my path and fell through fast.
Died and died, I died and died,
Found my form and made it last.

Feeling fine, feeling fine,
Done it all and feeling fine.
Mustn't stop, mustn't stop,
Done it all, I'm feeling fine.
Mustn't stop, I'm feeling fine.</pre>

Anyway, I'm still in a mixed state, I'm fucked, and <a class="pulse" href="/unemployment">it's my fault</a>.
