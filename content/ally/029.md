> Where did you go?

I was still here.

> Were you?

I was still at my computer. Still writing. I was still here?

> You'll have to forgive me for saying that I don't quite believe you.

Why wouldn't you? You're here with me, aren't you?

> Was I? It was like looking through cling wrap. It was like looking through melted glass.

What do you mean?

> Well, you were there. I could see you at your computer. You were there, but it wasn't **you**. There was a Madison-shape sitting with a laptop on the couch, petting the dogs, feeding the cat, listening to music, but it wasn't you.

I was busy, perhaps. *Restless Town* came out, that stole a lot of my time.

> When was the last time you filed an invoice at work?

Two...weeks ago. I think? Damn. Was I really gone that long?

> Longer. Do you remember what you did the week before that?

Worked, doubtless.

> Did you? Have you talked with work about that?

Ah.
