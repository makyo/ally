> Were you able to become a truly sexual person, would you?

Probably.

> What would that look like?

I'm not sure. Sexual liberation? All that stuff online, being able to do at least some of it in person? Some fantasies coming true? I'm writing this on my way to a furry convention where I'll be around three of my partners. Maybe it would look like having comfortable sex with them. Maybe it would be some low-consequences sex with friends, many of whom will also be there.

Perhaps it would simply look like less shame.

> Shame, according to BrenÃ© Brown, is rooted in vulnerability. Shame is the sense that "you are bad", as opposed to the "you did a bad thing" that goes along with guilt.

Yes. And there is some aspect of vulnerability that is healthy, but just an aspect of it, not the whole of it.

Were I able to become a truly sexual person, I'd probably do it.

> Do you feel bad that you aren't, then?

To an extent, but not bad enough to hunt down some sort of "fix". I don't feel broken, *per se*, at least not always, but I do feel like I'm missing out on something wonderful. I don't feel broken, but maybe I do feel a little jealous.
