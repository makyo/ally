What do you do when you've got a libido and relatively little will to act upon it? Delve into kink.

> Well, and fuck around on Taps a lot.

The two go hand in hand. When sex makes you intensely anxious, it turns out that getting tied up and blindfolded just sort of multiplies that anxiety.

> So you removed yourself from the equation.

Close enough, yes. I let my characters bear the weight of kink and sexual interaction. Textually, there's a vast divide between what's on the screen and what's going on in person. I can get all I need from kink without actually needing to interact with it.

> And what do you need from kink?

Beyond just fantasy fulfillment? A way to cope, I suppose.
