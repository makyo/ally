    /**
     Connections

     Connections should only lead from one quest to another the first time that
     link appears. No need to link to a quest a second time.

        Wasn't the point of this to be intentionally confusing?

     Yeah, but it was grating on me. All of those lines crossing, all those curves, side-quests pushed way down the page because I linked to them too many times.
