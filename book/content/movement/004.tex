Bit by bit, little by little, the tic once again slid from my life. Enough stressors had gone or were on their way out that I was gaining stillness.

I spent more and more days with fewer and fewer tics. I relished in the stillness.

It left for quite a while, and when it did come back, it did for only a day or two at a time. I eventually went a year without. Maybe two. I don't remember.
