Maddy built a sand castle and it was washed away.

The first friend was sad about the sand castle for Maddy, and said: better to not build the sand castle and risk further sorrow.

The second friend said this was good, because Maddy saw adversity and built the castle anyway.

The third said this was good because Maddy was able to acknowledge the castle and let it pass.

A fourth said: better to have never built the castle. The sand is itself, the wave is itself, and Maddy remains.

The fifth was helping build a bigger, better sand castle.
