A friend asked Maddy: why are you nailing boards together?

Maddy said: I'm building a house to live in.

When the friend came back later, there was an awkward jumble of sticks nailed together on the ground. They said: well that was dumb.

Some time later, the friend visited Maddy and asked: why are you frowning?

Maddy said: I paid someone to build me a house, but it's round, upside down, and a mile to the east of where it should be.

The friend shrugged and said: well that was dumb

Some time later, the friend visited Maddy and found her reading on the front porch of a cozy home. They said: did you build this?

Maddy said: no, but I did my part.

The friend laughed and sat down next to Maddy to read with her.
