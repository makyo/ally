You posted about those things publicly, but not privately, not one-on-one.

I know. I've been called on it before.

\begin{quote}
And since. Why?
\end{quote}

I suppose I need to be seen, but am not brave enough for it to be a conversation. I need to be seen but can't quite ask for help. I've promised everyone that I'm working on it, but the truth is, I don't know how I'd even begin to.

\begin{quote}
Is that what you're doing now?
\end{quote}

Perhaps.
