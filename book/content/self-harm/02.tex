Self harm

There is too much fire in me to be described by the soldering iron's tip.

\begin{quote}
I must not fear.
\end{quote}

Were I to draw it across my skin, it would all spill out at once.

\begin{quote}
Fear is the mind-killer.
\end{quote}

I'd melt, eaten whole by flames, and flow into a pool of molten glass.

\begin{quote}
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
\end{quote}

Sublimation would claim me, atoms would scatter, diffuse.

\begin{quote}
I will face my fear.
\end{quote}

I would be borne up through the clouds, and grow lighter by the second.

\begin{quote}
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
\end{quote}

All that energy poured to the air around me, an imperceptible increase in temperature.

\begin{quote}
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
\end{quote}

Particle would excite particle until I'm felt only as warmth on your face.

\begin{quote}
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
\end{quote}

But even that would not be enough.

\begin{quote}
Only I will remain.
\end{quote}
