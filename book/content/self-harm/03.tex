TIASAP stands for \emph{The Ill-Advised Self-Administration Period}.

This is why.

I was unsafe about it.

I lost my sexuality for years.

I turned the need for change into punishment.

The color drained from my universe. The flavor was gone from food. I could not smell.

I tell myself now that if I belive something to be true when I'm depressed as well as when I'm hypomanic, it's more likely to be right.

And, well.

Now I knew it was right.

But I was unsafe, I was punishing myself, and I did it all on purpose.
