So were you?

Was I what?

\begin{quote}
Fucked. Were you fucked?
\end{quote}

I think that's still to-be-determined.

\begin{quote}
You don't seem fucked. I mean, life is harder now, I suppose. You've got to contend with a minority identity you never particularly wanted.

There's no denying that. I don't quite like that this is what I'm stuck with, but I do alright with it. I try to keep going as best I can, and I try to help others as much as I can along the way. Robin likes to call me a ``trans psychopomp'', but I suspect that's due in part to the word `psychopomp' is really fun to say. I would say that she falls under that title as well.

\begin{quote}
Do you see yourself as one? Do you see yourself as someone who guides others?
\end{quote}

Not particularly. I feel like I'm doing everything by accident. I feel like I'm accidentally visibly trans. Like I can't help but be visibly trans, like that's what I've got to work with. That that helps others long the way is still something of a mystery. A pleasant one, but a mystery.

Still, the least I could do is not hurt, might as well put in the effort to be a help.

Do you think that others see you as a resource?
\end{quote}

Perhaps, though that has me worried. That's an awful lot of responsibility.
