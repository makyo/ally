\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
  It is surprisingly hard to think something real\\
  when every indication, every word, all you feel\\
  tells you that that must not be the case.\\
  There's no easy way to make yourself face\\
  that which your emotions continually deny,\\
  no matter how true you know it to be.\\!
  \vinphantom{no matter how true you know it to be.} But why\\
  must all these contradictions claim events\\
  that mean the most to us? What prevents\\
  them from taking the unimportant? The small?\\
  Is the import just to big? Can we not fit all\\
  of the thing in our heads? Are we too weak?\\
  Is the life-changing too vast to explore, to seek\\
  out every corner?
\end{verse}

\begin{ally}
  Have you considered that your constant seeking\\
  \noindent may be the problem? That your anxieties leaking\\
  \noindent all over may be what's preventing you\\
  \noindent from recognizing what's actually true:\\
  \noindent you can do things for yourself. It's allowed.
\end{ally}

\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
  It also doesn't help that there were so many delays.\\
  The scheduler losing my application, and me counting days\\
  after those who consulted after me got their dates;\\
  The mishap of the letters, and me rushing past gates\\
  and their keepers; countless thoughts of countless regrets ---\\
  regrets which hadn't yet happened --- as mom frets\\
  that maybe I will wind up hating my new body.\\
  And why not? Why not fret? Surgery! How gaudy.\\
  I fight with myself enough over how this surgery\\
  is plastic, how I'm just doing something sugary\\
  to somehow make myself somewhat more appealing.\\
  How trite. How selfish. How lame. How revealing\\
  of my bottomless shallowness.
\end{verse}

\begin{ally}
  Your saving grace being, as always, dysphoria:\\
  \noindent more than any cough or cold, more than your chorea,\\
  \noindent it provided you with a problem. Something fixable.\\
  \noindent It gave you a tangible solution to something integral\\
  \noindent that plagued you.
\end{ally}

\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
  That I had something I could concrete at which to point\\
  that would be fixed by this act, I could thus annoint\\
  it as somehow more worthy, something worth doing.\\
  If I could go through some process of ungluing,\\
  excise this thing from myself I might become whole\\
  in some way never before imagined.\\!
  \vinphantom{in some way never before imagined.} Ah, but the toll.\\
  There must always some arbitrary price to pay ---\\
  Self-actualization must never be free --- and hey,\\
  Everything in society must come with a reason.\\
  To come up with letters, proof, for that season\\
  of change must serve some sort of divine end.\\
  To wait eighteen long months, to refuse to bend\\
  to others' whims\ldots{}
\end{verse}

\begin{ally}
  You got your letters, you got your date, you did it.\\
  \noindent You did your labor, you did your time. They let you fidget\\
  \noindent and twist in the wind. Hell, they did it to you twice.\\
  \noindent Your letters only good for one year, you had to ask nice\\
  \noindent for a second set.
\end{ally}

\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
  Yes.\\!
  \vinphantom{Yes. } To preempt your 'why', I followed my own advice:\\
  If I feel the same when I'm depressed as I do when I feel nice,\\
  It's a thing worth doing. Eighteen months is time enough\\
  to let at least two depressive cycles call my own bluff.\\
  When they did not, when I panicked at having to reapply\\
  and still pulled through in time, well, no need to justify\\
  my actions any further. That's when it all became real.\\
  That's when I was in. That's when I could tell just by feel\\
  that I was ready for this change. I wasn't \emph{ready} ready,\\
  but I was ready enough to come off as rock steady\\
  when I called the surgeon's office. I was visibly confident,\\
  even at the pre-operative appointments, totally cognizant\\
  that I didn't deserve this.
\end{verse}

\begin{ally}
  Whether or not you deserve this is not up for debate.\\
  \noindent Not because you do or don't so much as because the hand fate\\
  \noindent dealt you. You had the job, you had the insurance, the means.\\
  \noindent You made the call. You took the step. You passed the screens.\\
  \noindent \textbf{You} did this.
\end{ally}
