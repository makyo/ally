The third.

Third?

\begin{quote}
You told Aunt Patty that you were gay back before high school.
\end{quote}

I\ldots{}did not remember that.

\begin{quote}
Not until just now, apparently.
\end{quote}

Apparently. I have no recollection of what I said. I have no recollection of what \emph{she} said.

I have no recollection of her.

\begin{quote}
Hazy images at grandma's.
\end{quote}

I guess.

\begin{quote}
Memories surrounding her.
\end{quote}

Lots of those.

\begin{quote}
Memories of when she and her family got stranded on a sailboat between Cuba and Florida and rescued by a cruise ship. Grandma and dad smug in their assessment that she was stupid and irresponsible.
\end{quote}

A vague, heavily pixelated picture shot by one of the cruise boat attendants.

\begin{quote}
``She's crazy,'' they said. ``She has too many kids. They draw all over the walls. Her house is wild. She's crazy.''
\end{quote}

And me, with with my secret. My little pet lie I kept hidden from them.

\begin{quote}
Tell me about coming out to dad.
\end{quote}

I will.
