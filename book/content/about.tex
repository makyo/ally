\emph{ally} is an autobiographical project. A lot of the information contained within is real, some of it isn't. Each page is structured as a conversation between myself and my ally, a mirror reflection of myself. The idea was originally cribbed from Dale Pendell's wonderful \emph{Pharmako/*} trilogy back in my late teens, but has since taken on a life of its own.

Other inspirations are Mark Z. Danielewski's {House} of Leaves and J. J. Abrams and Doug Dorst's S for both their ergodic elements and the underlying autobiographical elements. On the hypertextual side, projects such as the old \href{http://fray.com/index-old.shtml}{Fray} (notably the story \href{https://fray.com/drugs/worm/}{The Worm Within}) and \href{https://nobodyhere.com}{Nobody Here}. Bonus points to \href{http://www.ouverture-facile.com/}{Ouverture Facile} and the ilk for getting me thinking about online projects, even if this one isn't so riddly yet.
