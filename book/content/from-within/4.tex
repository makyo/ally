Self-harm

Let's talk about mania.

Finally.
\end{quote}

There's this rush.

This wild-nights-wild-nights rush.

There's this lack of foresight.

There's this thinking of the goal instead of the path.

There's this tinny scent to the air. There's this burning, burning sensation, burning. There's this pleasant static.

And\ldots{}
