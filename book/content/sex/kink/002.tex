I'm not really sure what to make of the fact that you made a bingo card for your kinks.
\end{quote}

Well, hey, hit bingo, and maybe I explode or something. Besides, \href{https://bbbingo.me}{bbbingo} was for a game jam.

\begin{quote}
So tell me about your free space.
\end{quote}

Actually, I think many of them come from a similar space: recasting bad or uncomfortable experiences from childhood into some positive light. A way to reclaim them and make them positive again.

How is humiliation positive?
\end{quote}

Okay, maybe some of them are not so much `again'.

\begin{quote}
I don't imagine non-consensual sex ever was, no.
\end{quote}

Not really, but using kink as a coping mechanism for anxieties around rape is at least a way forward for me.

Ditto humiliation. Being made to feel inadequate, often by people I was supposed to look up to, was such a negative force in my life --- in Matthew's life --- that it left me with quite a bit of baggage. This is just a way to sort through it.

\begin{quote}
Sexily.
\end{quote}

I suppose. It's something of a metakink. Many of the others stem from that, or from a similar core interest.

Scent-play as a means of degradation: why would a snow leopard smell of canine? Fits in nicely with knotting. Why not toss in some species denial, too; no more kitty, you say `arf' now.

Scruffing, in the context of furry, especially with felines, is a means of rendering one helpless. Coercion and weakened mental states fit as well. Those all sort of tag along with the non-consensual core kink

\begin{quote}
So, pain and blood? Breathplay?
\end{quote}

Yes. Abuse. Damage. Bad ends.

\begin{quote}
Where do those come from?
\end{quote}

Self hatred. Self harm. Destroy me before I destroy myself.

\begin{quote}
Really?
\end{quote}

No, of course not.

\begin{quote}
But some part of you actively believes that? Some part of you actively craves someone destroying you? Beating you bloody? Choking you? Leaving you for dead with casual nonchalance?
\end{quote}

Yes.
