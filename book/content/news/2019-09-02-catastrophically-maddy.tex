You seem to be working ever close to some platonic perfection of what means to be Maddy.

Yeah, this is one of those things where I seem to have looped all the way around from being proud of a work to being vaguely ashamed of it.

Right. So for those who are keeping track, so far we have had:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  A site map generated using GraphViz
\item
  Flashing GIFs of art of my furso√±as faces pinned to the page by their third eyes.
\item
  A guided meditation session accompanied by disjointed noise music which grows in intensity as the text corrupts.
\item
  A foxy face peering over a wall thinking grawlix at you.
\item
  A somewhat magical sigil that spins.
\end{itemize}

It's time to take that one step further, so the next section is told through git commits for the source code for this site.
