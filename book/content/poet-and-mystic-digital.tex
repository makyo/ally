\noindent \emph{Here is the difference betwixt the poet and the mystic, that the last nails a symbol to one sense, which was a true sense for a moment, but soon becomes old and false. For all symbols are fluxional; all language is vehicular and transitive, and is good, as ferries and horses are, for conveyance, not as farms and houses are, for homestead. Mysticism consists in the mistake of an accidental and individual symbol for an universal one.}

\begin{ally}
Pretty.
\end{ally}
I didn't write it.

\begin{ally}
I know.
\end{ally}
I scramble through great heaps of words and sounds to try and at least pin some of them to fleeting symbols. Maybe then I'll be able to learn to see more of the accidental and individual symbols.

\begin{ally}
Too many words, too many sounds.
\end{ally}
Yes.

\begin{ally}
You wrote four pieces about the winds coming down over the foothills near Boulder (for, of all things, wind quartet), just to try and capture one ecstatic experience.
\end{ally}
I like those. I like the result.

\begin{ally}
You like the first two, most of all. They remind you of how hollow you felt, how you could feel the wind blow through you, vibrating your soul like the pipe of an organ, exciting you to ever higher harmonics.
\end{ally}
Yes.

\begin{ally}
But then you kept writing.
\end{ally}
Yeah. I make a terrible poet.

\begin{ally}
You make a terrible mystic. Your poetry's just okay.

\noindent We wandered around for a bit before ending up sprawled in a fire-escape at FHS with Shannon in my lap, me in Ash's lap, and Andrew in Kiran's lap. Andrew ditched to go shooting with Ash and Kiran, while I went to bomb a history test. That's when things started getting really weird. I had a percoset relapse (whether that's what it was or not, it felt oddly similar to the real thing: an incurable itch buried beneath my skin, to the point where I can't actually scratch it) near the end of the period, and then in choir I imploded from empathy - so many emotions from others that I had no room for my own. Then, horns grew from my chest and head, and wings from my back; a giant fox escaped, left, and exploded into a thousand birds over Viele. Mind you, none of this really happened, but I sure felt strange. During latin, I exploded from empathy in a patchwork swirl of colors while Starin et al. stared on as I banged my head against the desk. Ms. Gibert didn't notice. I yelled for help inaudibly and searched out white points of light in the black silhouette of Boulder. I yelled for Ash and searched for Moondog.

Afterwards, I figured out how to regain control (mostly) and just in time for the bell to ring. I got a small mocha at Cafe Sole, got eaten by small greenish crystals on a table while supposed psychics did fairy readings from a kids book, and here I am, about to take a shower and get ready for Great Works rehearsal, and then group, whereupon I shall request to Reiki Moondog (again) during the speakers board on gay marriage. Hopefully I don't ex-/im-plode again \^{}\^{}\index{Relationships!Michael}

\noindent You have come, finally, to a safe place. You have arrived at the point where it counts most, the point at which Life itself seems to fall away, leaving behind nothing of it's former shell: that blackened husk of body and mind that housed a bright bright star. Years and years, it took, places and places and each day offering good and bad, but you, lucky you, saw past that, saw beyond the grid of your perception to see inside others, touching and caressing the bright points of light that were essentially them, cherishing each for not only their good points, but for their faults as well. The energy flowed around and through you in the concentric spirals of the labyrinth and the Bat Qol kept you clean and pure with the voice of God and the Buddha in me to the Buddha in you weaved everything under the sun into Life itself. This is Rapture.

\noindent Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani.

Upon reading certain things, upon hearing certain songs, upon seeing certain people, upon smelling certain scents, upon tasting certain foods, upon feeling certain feelings and upon losing myself, it flows, the light, in through the head, out through the heart, washes over all, and, being lost in it, have found myself without.

\begin{ally}
How poetic.
\end{ally}
These are the white things. Cold, bright, burning, white.

Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani.

But the light isn't as it used to be. It was a thing to light up a day, a thing to light up me, filling completely. Now a simple thread flows from head to heart, and the light doesn't stray from the path of least resistance.

\begin{ally}
Love follows not the law of Ohm.
\end{ally}
Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani.

Light can be many things, but here, now, it means love - all four loves - and it's a strange feeling to have been so full of it for so long, then to suddenly be nearly without.

\begin{ally}
Full of what? Full of shit? How pathetic, how trite.
\end{ally}
Having deified love for several years, it's a shock to my faith to have it disappear, even if it only turns out to be temporary.

\begin{ally}
Faith? You're faithful? How have you EVER been faithful to love?
\end{ally}
Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani!

It's about meaning and self. It's about defining where your boundaries are; your physical boundaries, your mental boundaries, your spiritual and emotional boundaries. It's about that ground-state training that you undergo so that you might step just a bit to the side. An inch. A mile. An age.

It's about breathing in for the count of four, holding for the count of two, breathing out for the count of four, holding for the count of two. It's about feeling where your feet touch the ground. It's about drawing a straight line from your center of gravity to the center of the world. It's about becoming totally present.

Used to be you and I daily would walk\\
through the fields out back of the house and talk\footnote{Riverbend Ponds Natural Area, Fort Collins, CO.}\\
for hours, spilling words and emotions.\\
These walks were our daily devotions\\
to each other over the years.

The fields, dotted with ponds, were our space.\\
We tramped those trails strung like lace\\
along shores and through tall grass,\\
murmuring now like winds, chattering now like brass\\
in some changeful duet.

You'd tell me about the geese in the sky,\\
would watch me stand still and not ask why\\
the birds scared me to pieces,\footnote{makyo.ink/bruise-vision/}\\
even as we dodged around their feces\footnote{makyo.ink/the-dogs-assure-me/}\\
littering the trails.

You'd put up with my fickle interests,\\
running with me, or stopping to see what arrests\\
my attention.\footnote{Shpongle --- A new way to say hooray!} You'd follow all of my changes\\
and change along with me through all the ranges\\
of our shared experience.

And over time, those walks got slower,\\
shorter, less frequent, or over\\
far too soon, though no less meaningful\\
as we spent our time together in cheerful\\
conversation or kind quiet.

We each seemed to be going our separate ways,\\
with me branching out, exploring different lays\\
of different lands, and you turning inwards,\\
exploring lines of thought you never put in words,\\
at least not that you told me.

And then one day, we once more went out walking\\
and though it took a while, you got to talking.\\
You told me of how  you sat, quiet and alone,\\
waiting for the time you might turn to stone\footnote{Quasimodo's line "Why was I not made of stone like thee?"; or, perhaps, part of a Chinese saying, "I will close my eyes and my heart and become a stone".}\\

Beginnings are such delicate times\footnote{Frank Herbert's \emph{Dune}.}\\

Soon, you were consumed, transformed as a whole.\\
Your head a crown of leaves, your heart a bole\\

I stood a while by the tree that was you,\footnote{A dream: \emph{I am walking along a trail in the Riverbend Ponds and start to feel dizzy, so I fall to my knees and clutch at the soil.

\noindent There was a sort of succulent quality to the air, as though, were I to bite down on it, it would all come bursting forth at once. Dribble down my chin. Stain my shirt. It would be sweet, almost saccharine. It would beg for a pinch of salt to quell all that sweetness.

I didn't know whether or not I'd be able to stomach it, honestly. I was dizzy. I was apart from myself. Above, and beside. I was looking down at myself. Were I to do so, to bite into time itself, I would surely overflow.

\emph{Was} overflowing, I realized. Was bending forward at the waist where I was sitting. Those black choir chairs were comfortable, but made you sit up straight, so I couldn't slouch. I was bending forward, resting my elbows on my knees, and then bowing my head, bowing further.

I was overflowing, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. We weren't singing, the basses, we were watching the altos rehears a part, so it wasn't too far out of the ordinary for me to be hunched over, breathing shallow, watching myself from above.

I was overflowing, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. Hunched over, breathing shallow, and watching from a few feet up, a few feet to the right, so that I could see my shirt tear even as I felt it against my back. I was so thin, then. So thin.

I was overflowing, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I watched my shirt tear, and my skin follow. I watched it split along my spine and peel back. It was bloodless, but not painless. The feeling of those wings, newborn and weak, slipping from the wound was raw.

I was overflowing, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I watched the wings stretch and extend from the wound on my back. ``Aha,'' I thought. ``This is it. This is finally it. It's finally happening. I am becoming something greater, and here I am, so unprepared!''

I was overflowing, though, not transforming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. The growth did not stop at wings. An eye. A beak. The graceful curve of a head. Plumage.\index{Numinous!birds|(}

``No, this isn't it.'' I panicked, and could think of nothing else but to apologize. ``I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.''

The bird cocked its head as it climbed free of my back and perched on my shoulder. It cared not for apologies. Why would it?

Another pair of wings followed.

Another.

Another.

My hands were buried in my hair, I could see - barely - through the forest of pencil-thin legs crowding my shoulders, my neck, my head. Their weight had forced my shoulders down until my head was nearly between my knees.

We were singing now, and I was silent. How could I sing, when all I could do was beg silently for forgiveness? How could I sing with the weight of a dozen crows slowly crushing me into my seat? How could I sing when I was overflowing? There was nothing I could do to stop it

Chaos. The director stopped the choir, and as one, the flock lifted off. The weight was lifted off my back. The cacophony filled the air. I was borne up through the air by the birds. The birds were splitting, multiplying, avian mitosis. I was borne up, up. Up.

I was told afterward that my body stumbled, unthinking along the row and toward the double doors, that the director had sneered, "It sure would be nice if we had all our singers here today." I was told that folks defended me, saying I was sick, I was pale, I was feverish.

I don't know, I wasn't there. I was above the Flatirons. I was beyond terror. I was beyond joy. I was beyond sensation, beyond any emotion except for that bottomless, black guilt. Sticky. Tar-like. Bitter. The flock numbered in the thousands, and still we flew up.

The blue of the sky became white, blinded, became black, and I was sitting in the hallway. I was with my body again. I was sobbing. A teacher stared. Students gave me a wide berth.

I cleaned myself up. I went back to choir. What else could I do?

A bird had plucked something from me. Something precious. Something unknowable. Something important and integral. Something hard. Something emerald and glassy. Before the white of the sky overtook me, I saw it in its beak.

The caw it gave as my vision left me and my ears filled with static was\ldots{}triumphant? No, not quite. Triumph implies that the birds could do anything but succeed. In that sound was inevitability.

After school, - - - and I tramped through the `mini-forest' and, impelled by something of the avian within, I collected five sticks.\index{Numinous!birds|)}

They had to be as straight as possible.

They had to be balanced as close to the middle as possible.

They had to be the same length without me breaking them.

They had to have been from different trees.

They had to have fallen more than a year prior.

When I got home, I lay them in a row, asked my questions, and, one by one, broke them in half.

\begin{quotation}
\emph{What had I lost?}

\emph{What had I gained?}

\emph{Where had I gone?}

\emph{Where did I come from?}

\emph{Why does memory stain me with that black, tarry guilt?}
\end{quotation}

I had forgotten about the birds until recently, but every time I feel that ecstasy --- that ekstasis --- I am pitch. I am tar. I am sticky with apology. I am the living embodiment of ``I'm sorry''.
