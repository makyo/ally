You made me cry.

\begin{quote}
I know.
\end{quote}

You hurt me.

Yit'gadal v'yit'kadash sh'mei raba Would that I had the faith To pray daily. Eleven months to let you go, And an amen to end the sorrow.

It's okay to not let go of some things.

How? How so? How could that possibly be true? How could one possible grow as a person with not letting go of something?

It's okay to not let go of some things, and to use them to inform your growth in the future. It's okay to use grief to become a better person.

But it still hurts.

\begin{quote}
I know. We can continue.
