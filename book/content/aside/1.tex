Is it weird for me to be streaming writing like this?

\begin{quote}
I don't know. Does it feel weird to you?
\end{quote}

I guess. I feel like maybe it's weird to be writing for an audience (even if it's only theoretical). What sort of information can be gleaned from watching someone write in a word-processor? Method? Insight?

Entertainment?
\end{quote}

I don't know about that.

\begin{quote}
Validation?
\end{quote}

That's more like it, I suppose. It's a way to prove to others that I actually sit down and write these things. That there's someone there.

\begin{quote}
That there's someone behind a memoir? How novel.
\end{quote}

Well, yes. But that they take time, that they take energy. That it's a process and not a product.

\begin{quote}
Is there some sense of validity that is lacking from simply publishing? Posting?
\end{quote}

I don't know.

You set up analytics on this site. And on your writing site.
\end{quote}

I set up analytics on a lot of sites.

\begin{quote}
But these in particular. Do you need to see that others see you?
\end{quote}

I suppose I do. It's important to be recognized.

\begin{quote}
Are you also doing this to get me to leave you alone about heavier topics?
\end{quote}

Yes.
