Where did you go?
\end{quote}
I was still here.

\begin{quote}
Were you?
\end{quote}
I was still at my computer. Still writing. I was still here?

\begin{quote}
You'll have to forgive me for saying that I don't quite believe you.
\end{quote}
Why wouldn't you? You're here with me, aren't you?

\begin{quote}
Was I? It was like looking through cling wrap. It was like looking through melted glass.
\end{quote}
What do you mean?

\begin{quote}
Well, you were there. I could see you at your computer. You were there, but it wasn't \textbf{you}. There was a Madison-shape sitting with a laptop on the couch, petting the dogs, feeding the cat, listening to music, but it wasn't you.
\end{quote}
I was busy, perhaps. \emph{Restless Town} came out, that stole a lot of my time.

\begin{quote}
When was the last time you filed an invoice at work?
\end{quote}
Two\ldots{}weeks ago. I think? Damn. Was I really gone that long?

\begin{quote}
Longer. Do you remember what you did the week before that?
\end{quote}
Worked, doubtless.

\begin{quote}
Did you? Have you talked with work about that?
\end{quote}
Ah.

\begin{quote}
Let's talk about burnout, shall we?
\end{quote}
We probably better had.
