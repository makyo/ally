I want to save it.

\ally{But you save it like this. You save it in a book. You obscure the meaning, but it's there. It's in the ink. It's on the page. It's in the realm of the physical.}

That's not the same as sharing.

\ally{It's exactly the same as sharing.}

And who asked you?

\ally{Who invoked me?}

Well played.
