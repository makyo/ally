\noindent I'm not ready to share this yet.

\begin{ally}
But you want to save it?
\end{ally}
I want to save it.

\begin{ally}
But you save it like this. You save it in a book. You obscure the meaning, but it's there. It's in the ink. It's on the page. It's in the realm of the physical.
\end{ally}
That's not the same as sharing.

\begin{ally}
It's exactly the same as sharing.
\end{ally}
And who asked you?

\begin{ally}
Who invoked me?
\end{ally}
Well played.
