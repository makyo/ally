Tell me about mania.
\end{quote}

No.

Wait, what? Why are you asking? Weren't you there?

\begin{quote}
I was. I\ldots{}am?

I don't think I'm hypomanic now. On my way, perhaps. I can't sleep.

\begin{quote}
I may be, then. Tell me about mania.
\end{quote}

No, tell me why you're asking.

\begin{quote}
I'm more of a liminal creature, myself. It's hard to keep an ally around when depression slowly shuts down avenue after avenue of reaching one. You, as a reflection of me, become distorted while manic. Fun-house mirrors and blind-spots. I want to hear about it.
\end{quote}

No.

Later.

I took a sleep aid. I'm not getting into this now. I was all prepped to write about poly stuff, but you started banging on the door.

Read what I've already written.

\begin{quote}
I was there when you wrote those.
\end{quote}

So? Does that not clarify it?

\begin{quote}
Will anything?
\end{quote}

Likely not.

I will say, though, that I missed some stuff in my investigation earlier. You did come back for three brief days in November, 2013. It was at a liminal time, but you didn't stick around.

\begin{quote}
I'll remind you that you ignored me for one of those posts.
\end{quote}

Point.

Let's get into mania later. We owe each other that. For now, bed. And tomorrow, something a little less harrowing.

Ah yes. Polyamory. Known for being easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
