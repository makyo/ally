\noindent I'm sorry this is taking so long.

\begin{ally}
To whom are you apologizing?
\end{ally}
You? Or is that not your department?

\begin{ally}
Not really, no. Doubtless, I appreciate --- if that's the right word --- the time we spend together, but only in the sense that one appreciates one's ears popping. The world that exists for me when you're not engaging with me is just the world. A bit muffled, perhaps. I can't hear as well. I hear by speaking, and when I can speak, there's a little pop, and suddenly I can hear much better.
\end{ally}
That's a very embodied-person thing to say.

\begin{ally}
So? Is a metaphor not allowed to use metaphors?
\end{ally}
I suppose so.
