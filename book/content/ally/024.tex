\noindent Do you hate me?

\begin{ally}
Not my department.
\end{ally}
Right.

\begin{ally}
Do you hate me?
\end{ally}
I don't know. Sometimes you get kind of mean. Often you're just sarcastic. I know it's not your department, but shouldn't that also mean that you be less pointedly negative?

\begin{ally}
I am a mirror. Do I reflect too sharply?
\end{ally}
Are you? Really?

\begin{ally}
An inexact metaphor.
\end{ally}
I suppose. If you're a mirror, then, at least in some sense, does that mean that I hate me?

\begin{ally}
Name one thing about yourself, one bit of your history, one feeling you have for yourself that is not complex.
\end{ally}
I waver, sometimes, on that stupid phrase, \emph{coming to terms with being a terrible person}. I felt for so long that, when I looked back at myself, at who I was, that I had been someone worth loathing, and it made me wonder that perhaps I was still someone worth loathing.

\begin{ally}
If you hate who you used to be, mightn't that be an indicator that you've become a better person? \textbf{Non sum qualis eram}, right?
\end{ally}
That might just be the kindest thing you've said to me.

\begin{ally}
Not my department.
\end{ally}
