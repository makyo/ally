How can I capture that essence of stillness? How can I become nothing?

\begin{quote}
Not reaching. Not trying.
\end{quote}

How can I read the ecstasy of signs? How can I feel those black birds bursting free of my hunched shoulders?

\begin{quote}
Step beside yourself. Take your own hand.
\end{quote}

How can I feel the cord that ties me to the center of the earth? How can I see where it leads? How can I walk the spiral?

\begin{quote}
Reach down, bury your fingers in rich earth, take root.
\end{quote}

The cant of ritual.

\begin{quote}
The scent of incense.
\end{quote}

The rhythm of chant.

\begin{quote}
The ripple of water.
\end{quote}

Call and response.

\begin{quote}
The flicker of a candle.
\end{quote}

Voices echoing voices echoing voices echoing\ldots{}

\begin{quote}
Clay between fingertips.
\end{quote}

And then?
